My research focus is gene regulation of nervous system development and neurodegenerativediseases especially using evolutionary aspects. To understand nervous system, Imainly use multi-omic data analysis techniques such as scRNAseq, scATACseq,and ChIPseq by extensively usage of Linux (HPC clusters and bash scripting), R,and Python. I am also Linux enthusiastic and interested in web development. Onthe other hands, I am also interested in philosophy of science."
